# Handymon - Simple, Free Windows Server & SQL Server Monitoring

Handymon is a lightweight, free monitoring tool for small businesses, schools, churches, and organizations with limited IT resources. It focuses on what matters most: sending alerts when servers, databases, or disks need attention.

Monitor multiple Windows Servers and SQL Server instances without limits. Receive timely notifications via email or Slack, schedule blackout periods for maintenance, and automate routine checks with background polling threads.

Built for the lone IT worker, Handymon is easy to install, simple to configure, and scales as your organization grows. No dashboards, no licensing fees, no unnecessary complexity - just reliable alerts when you need them.

Handymon - simple, free, and built to just work.
